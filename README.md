## 🚀 About Me

Hi, I’m **Manish Kumar**, a passionate **MERN Stack Developer** with a strong interest in building scalable and user-friendly web applications.

&#x20;           I completed my **Bachelor of Computer Applications** (BCA) in 2024 and Recently, I completed my **MERN Full Stack Development Course**.

I’ve built several hands-on projects, including an **Expense Tracker** App with secure **JWT-based authentication**, and a **Full-featured E-commerce (ShopToday) platform** using **Redux for state management**, a **Rich Text Editor** for dynamic product descriptions, and the **DataTables library** for efficient **Data Representation** with **search**, **pagination**, and **filtering**.

I love learning new technologies, debugging complex problems, and writing clean, maintainable code. My goal is to become a **proficient Full Stack Developer** who builds impactful digital solutions and grows with every challenge.
